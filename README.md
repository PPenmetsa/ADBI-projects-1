# ADBI-projects
Homework and projects done in the course CSC591 Algorithms for Data-Guided Business Intelligence (ADBI)  (Spring 2019) (ongoing) <br> 
**Instructor: Prof. Nagiza Samatova**

## Projects
### Project 1: Data Wrangling with Python and Pandas
Concepts:
- Data Acquisition
- Data Cleansing
- Data Understanding: Basics
- Data Manipulation
### Project 2: Recommender System with ALS and Apache Spark
Create a recommender system using Spark and the collaborative filtering technique that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history.
### Project 3: Sentiment Analysis with Spark Streaming
Perform a basic sentiment analysis of realtime tweets, i.e., processing live data streams using Spark’s streaming APIs and Python.
### Project 4: Network Properties with Apache Spark
Implement various network properties using pySpark, GraphFrames and networkx:
- Degree Distribution: a measure of the frequency of nodes that have a certain degree
- Centrality: determine nodes that are important based on the structure of the graph. Closeness centrality measures the distance of a node to all other nodes.
- Articulation Points: vertices in the graph that, when removed, create more components than there were originally. 
### Project 5: Bitcoin Price Prediction with Bayesian Regression
predicting the price variations of bitcoin, a virtual cryptographic currency using Bayesian Regression. Using [this](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1231.pdf) paper as reference computer price variations, linear regression parameters and build linear regression model with bayesian estimates.
### Project 6: AdWords Placement with Online Bipartite Matching
We are given a set of advertisers each of whom has a daily budget 𝐵𝑖. When a user
advertisement slot. The bid of advertiser 𝑖 for an ad request 𝑞 is denoted as 𝑏 . We assume that 𝑖𝑞
performs a query, an ad request is placed online and a group of advertisers can then bid for that
the bids are small with respect to the daily budgets of the advertisers (i.e., for each 𝑖 and 𝑞, 𝑏𝑖𝑞 ≪ 𝐵𝑖). Moreover, each advertisement slot can be allocated to at most one advertiser and the advertiser is charged his bid from his/her budget. The objective is to maximize the amount of money received from the advertisers.
For this project, we make the following simplifying assumptions:
1. For the optimal matching (used for calculating the competitive ratio), we will assume
everyone’s budget is completely used. (optimal revenue = the sum of budgets of all
advertisers)
2. The bid values are fixed (unlike in the real world where advertisers normally compete by
incrementing their bid by 1 cent).
3. Each ad request has just one advertisement slot to display.

## Homeworks
### Homework 1: GLM Logistic Regression
Build the logistic regression model (fit.all) using all the predictor in R and answer questions related to basics of logistic regression like equations, log-odds, statisitical significance, dispersion, etc.
### Homework 2: Bayesian Parameter Estimation
Bayesian Estimation of the Parameters of a Gaussian Distribution and answer related questions.
### Homework 3: Stochastic Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression
Implement SGD for the Logistic Regression problem from scratch.
